                    Hey! My name is Shalaina and I was born and raised in Montana. Being a 
                    photographer in this beautiful state is such a blessing as there is 
                    never a question of where to find a beautiful location for photos. 
                    Photography is truly my passion and I look forward to each session with
                    excitement. I love being creative and trying new things. My goal is to 
                    catch you and your loved ones having fun and being candid with one 
                    another. I love every type of session and I would love to work with 
                    you so please feel free to message me with any questions you may 
                    have!
                </p>
